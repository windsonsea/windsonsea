# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Michael Yao

I'm a CNCF Ambassador and open source contributor involved in projects like Kubernetes, PyTorch, vLLM, SGLang, Istio, and OpenTelemetry.
I enjoy building, documenting, and mentoring in the open source community â€” with a passion for observability, cloud-native infrastructure, and AI technologies.
